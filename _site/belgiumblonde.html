								<p> The Electric Blonde, a Belgian Blonde Ale, was the teamâ€™s first attempt at an all grain beer.  I am pleased to announce its success and stunning appeal as it was bottled.   The brewing process began with almost 7 kg of crushed grains, including aromatic, Bohemian Pilsner, and Wheat.  These created the mash and were cooked and sparged for 1.5 hours until all of the carbohydrates(sugars) had been released.</p>

								<p> Next came the hops which helped to create the complex flavours found in the wort.  Mount Hood hops were used for its bittering properties, Magnum for its flavouring and finally Citra to give it that perfect aroma.  After boiling the wort and adding in hops for time intervals of (60mins), (30mins), (10mins), it was ready for the fermenter.  Throughout the fermentation process, we used a thermo probe to keep track of the fermenter and ambient temperatures.  The fermentation process held at about 21 degrees celsius with ambient at 19 degrees celsius and took 4 days until the biological reactions began to decrease.  The fermented wort was allowed to sit for another week allowing for sedimentation and a cleaner beer.  The moment the beer was poured, the calculated 6.0 SRM was clearly visible and the light fruity aroma filled the air. The original gravity(OG) was measured to be 1.039 and the final gravity(FG) to be a 1.004 giving an alcohol content(ABV) of 4.7%.  The gravities of the process were lower than expected but still gave values within the desired range and allowed for minimal sediment suspended in the beer. For improvements for the future, longer sparging will be conducted to ensure all sugars are extracted from the grains.
